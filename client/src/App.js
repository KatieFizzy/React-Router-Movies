/* 

Inside your App file add two routes.
one route for / that loads the MovieList component.
one route that will take an id parameter 
after/movies/ (ex: /movies/2, /movies/3 where the id is dynamic). 
This route should load the Movie component.


Make it so that the card in MovieList is a link, 
this should direct the user to the /movies/{id of movie here} URL, 
where :id is the id of the individual movie.
When a user clicks on a movie card they should be 
taken to /movies/{id of movie here} to see the details for the selected movie.
You will need to modify line 13 of Movie.js in order to accept 
the correct id for the movie selected.Add functionality so the Home button 
on the SavedList component navigates back to home.
You should now be able to navigate back and forth between 
the individual movies and the home screen

  <Route 
          exact path={`/Movies/${Movie.id}`}
          render={props => (
          <Movie {...props} movieList={MovieList}/>)}/>
